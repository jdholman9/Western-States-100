# Western-States-100

race results from 1986 until present and some analysis

The Western States 100 mile foot race that is the Wimbledon of ultra-marathons (races longer than a marathon).  

My Uncle completed the race in 2012 and follows is closely.  He knows many others who are ultra marathoners such as the woman who has broken almost all women long foot race records.

This is how I got involved.  I saw my uncle staring at a spread sheet one day and decided to manage the large amounts of data and see what I could do.
